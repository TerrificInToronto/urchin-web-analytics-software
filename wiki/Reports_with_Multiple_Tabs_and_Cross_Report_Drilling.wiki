=Reports with Multiple Tabs and Cross Report Drilling=

In Urchin7 supported report structures were extended with the following new functionality:

  * reports with multiple tabs
  * possibility to display different metric sets at different drill-down levels
  * possibility to switch the detail level in reports

==Reports with Multiple Tabs==

In rs2-file each report with some tabs has NDATA field equal to number of tabs and each tab has prefix T in unique report ID in the tab definition list after the main report.

On the picture below you can see how  two reports "Top Files" and "Downloads" from "IT Report/Pages&Files" section can be merged in one report with two tabs
