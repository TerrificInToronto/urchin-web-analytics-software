=== Overview ===   
A permanent link ("permalink") is a link to an Urchin report that preserves the exact settings of the report, like filtering, paging, etc. It can be embedded into e-mail or Web pages.<br><br>
A "Permalink" link is provided on the Urchin report control panel. Clicking this link opens a popup from which you can copy the permalink.      

TODO: screen

=== Permalink features: ===
  * Permanent links are accessible from the report page only;
  * Permanent links include the current settings of profile, selected report, date ranges, filtering, drill-down level and paging;
  * Permalink does not preserve the currently open popup reports like "Data Over Time" or "To-date Lifetime Value". It does not also preserve the currently open cross-segment ;
  * Permanent links depend on the execution context, i.e. the link acquired from under the session controller is processed via the session controller interface; the link acquired via the direct report linking is processed via the direct report linking interface.
  
=== Limitations: ===
  * A permanent link to the admin interface is not allowed to avoid XSRF and accidental data modification;
  * A permanent link doesn't restore the state of  the "Performance Comparison" report .
